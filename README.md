Groundwater Level Prediction using Unsupervised Learning
Predicting groundwater levels is crucial for sustainable water resource management, agricultural planning, and urban development. This project leverages unsupervised machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and KMeans Clustering to analyze and predict risk patterns in groundwater levels.

This repository contains a complete pipeline for:
Preprocessing groundwater datasets
Dimensionality reduction using PCA
Clustering regions based on groundwater risk using KMeans
Visualizing the patterns to assist in regional water conservation strategies

The goal is to provide early warning and categorization of groundwater risk levels to help policymakers and researchers in water resource planning.
