Groundwater Level Prediction using Unsupervised Learning
Predicting groundwater levels is crucial for sustainable water resource management, agricultural planning, and urban development. This project leverages unsupervised machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and KMeans Clustering to analyze and predict risk patterns in groundwater levels.
